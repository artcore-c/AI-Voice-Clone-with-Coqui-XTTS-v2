SAMPLE OUTPUTS FOLDER

This folder will contain your generated voice clones after running the Colab notebook.

Your cloned audio files will download to /content/cloned_voice.wav in Colab, which you can then download to your local machine.

Note: Sample audio files are not included in this repository for privacy reasons. Generate your own using the tutorial!
